# EnICS-Templates
Template for creating Overleaf project


To start an Overleaf project based on this template, you have two options:
1) (preferred) Adding the project to your github.com account.
2) (alternative option) Cloning the project from https://github.com/enics-labs/EnICS-Templates and uploading it to your Overleaf account.

For option 1, you will need to follow these steps:

*Preliminaries:*
1) You need to have a github.com account 
2) You have to have a professional overleaf account, which you are eligible for free if you are an IEEE Member.

*First Time Only Procedure:*
1) Send Prof. Adam Teman an email with your github username (adam.teman@biu.ac.il)
2) You will then receive an invitation to the "EnICS Templates" project on github
3) Login to github and accept the invitation
4) On your Overleaf dashboard, click on *MENU-->New Project-->Import from GitHub*
5) You will be asked to *link your github account* with your Overleaf account. Follow the instructions.

*Every time you want to start a new Overleaf project:*
1) On your Overleaf dashboard, click on *MENU-->New Project-->Import from GitHub*
2) Select "EnICS Templates". You will now have a project called "EnICS Templates" in your Overleaf project list.
3) Go into the "EnICS Templates" project and click *MENU-->Copy Project*
4) Give your project a new name and start writing!

Note that you are not supposed to work directly on the EnICS Template project, which is a public repository. That is why we make a copy. 
As a new user, you will be added as a "reader"to the project, and therefore cannot commit new changes. 
If you become a power user, I will make you a collaborator, so you can add new features to the template.
Also note that you will not be able to pull recent changes from the repo, since Overleaf does a "merge and commit", which requires write permissions. 
Therefore, if you are starting a new project and want the latest version of the templates, delete the "EnICS Template" project from your Overleaf dashboard and import it again before making a copy.

Please email adam.teman@biu.ac.il with any comments or suggestions and/or if you want to become a collaborator!
