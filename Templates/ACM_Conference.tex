  \blue{This document is intended to serve as a sample for submissions to the 57\textsuperscript{th} IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture\textsuperscript{\textregistered} (MICRO 2024). We provide some guidelines that authors should follow when submitting papers to the conference.  This format is derived from the ACM sig-alternate.cls file, and is used with an objective of keeping the submission version similar to the camera-ready version.}

\section{Introduction}

\blue{This document provides instructions for submitting papers to the 57\textsuperscript{th} IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture\textsuperscript{\textregistered} (MICRO 2024).  In an effort to respect the efforts of reviewers and in the interest of fairness to all prospective authors, we request that all submissions to MICRO 2024 follow the formatting and submission rules detailed below. Submissions that violate these instructions may not be reviewed, at the discretion of the program chairs, in order to maintain a review process that is fair to all potential authors.}

\blue{This document is itself formatted using the MICRO 2024 submission format. The content of this document mirrors that of the submission instructions that appear on the conference website. All questions regarding paper formatting and submission should be directed to the program chairs.}

\section{Paper Preparation Instructions}

\subsection{Paper Formatting}

\blue{Papers must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain a {\em maximum of 11 pages} of single-spaced two-column text, {\bf not including references}.  You may include any number of pages for references, but see below for more instructions.  If you are using \LaTeX to typeset your paper, then we suggest that you use the template here: \href{https://www.microarch.org/micro56/submit/micro56-latex-template.zip}{\LaTeX~Template}. This document was prepared with that template. Note that the template and sample paper may render slightly differently on different \LaTeX~engines, due to typesetting changes between versions. If you use a different software package to typeset your paper, then please adhere to the guidelines given in Table~\ref{table:formatting}. }

\blue{{\em Please ensure that you include page numbers with your submission}. This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different parts of your paper when they provide comments. Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the title page, similar to this document, which contains the submission number and the notice of confidentiality.  If using the template, just replace XXX with your submission number.}
