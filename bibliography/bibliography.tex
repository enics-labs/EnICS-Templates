%    This file configures your bibliography
%        Just a bit cleaner than having a long list of bib 
%          files in your main document
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Start by defining the bibliography style
%    Some commonly used styles:
%       IEEEtran    - for most IEEE Transactions and Conference Proceedings
\ifacmjournal
    \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\else 
    \ifmicro
        \bibliographystyle{IEEEtranS}
    \else
        \bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}
    \fi
\fi


% Now provide a list of bibliography files to include within the \bibliography command
%   These files are stored in the "bibliography" folder
%   There is an "abbreviations.bib" file which includes long and short names for common journals and confernces
%   There should be a file for papers published by each of the EnICS Staff members
%   There is a "general_bibliography" file for things we tend to cite a lot (e.g., ITRS)
%   Put your paper-specific citations in the "this_bibliography.bib" file
\bibliography{bibliography/abbreviations,
              bibliography/general_biblography,
              bibliography/teman_bibliography,
              bibliography/this_bibliography}
